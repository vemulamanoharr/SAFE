1) Settings:

Choose from 2 safety level settings: 'Strict' or 'Trace Amounts OK'. Strict will return only products with almost predominately positive user experience and/or guarantee from the manufacturer that no sulfites were used in the production of the item. Choose this if even small exposures cause anaphylactic reactions. Trace amounts products still excludes most processed foods, but includes items with varying user experiences but enough recommendations to be worth sharing.

2) Searching:

Before you can search, you must view the disclaimer.To search based on your sensitivity level, save your level in settings. The default level is to only return items which are considered to contain zero sulfites. To search by product, or specific food type, input the name of the product you would like evaluated, hit enter, and a list of items containing those words in the name will be returned. For instance, you could type “Organic Valley Butter” and get both unsalted and salted varieties returned, or you could type in “unsalted butter” and items from several brands may be listed. Click Search again to search for another item."
